Your .env file is a top priority for the whole system to work, you will need to make one under "services_keys".
In here you will need to put all your api keys in to.

---!!!---

If you move your .env file it's necessary that you edit the line in "jadeai_main.py".
"sys.path.append("services_keys")", to the folder you moved it to.
So if you moves it to "ai_python" then edit it to "sys.path.append("ai_python")".

- How can you set the .env file up?

I did this with mine: 

# Here is all our API's for the AI

OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# =============================

# Here is all our API's for accessibility to other services

GOOGLE_GMAIL_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
GOOGLE_CALLENDER_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# =============================

# Here is out database API
# DB password: xxxxxxxx

# =============================
# =============================

There is also a vosksystem, our vosk system is the part of JadeAI where it detects what you are saying and telling it to JadeAI.
If you want to switch its model or language then visit this official website: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
On there you can download various vosk models.

If you switch model you need to replace the folder "vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15" with the vosk model you downloaded,
and then you need to replace this part of the code in "speechtotext.py" 
MODEL_PATH = "vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15" -> to MODEL_PATH = "YOUR-VOSK-MODEL-XX-XX-0.00".
